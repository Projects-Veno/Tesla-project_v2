        <p>Model X is the safest SUV ever, with standard active safety features and hardware built to provide
           visibility that a driver cannot access alone. Eight surround cameras allow for 360-degree vision,
            while twelve ultrasonic sensors provide detection of surrounding objects. Forward-facing radar
             see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and beyond the vehicle ahead—helping to prevent accidents by
              providing simultaneous visibility in every direction. Model X is the first SUV ever to achieve a
               5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category, the lowest probability of occupant injury,
                and a rollover risk half that of any SUV on the road.</p>

          <p>Model X is able to achieve 295 miles of range in part because it is the most

             the next best SUV. </br> </br>
              The Model X's 10-kWh onboard charging system means a drained 90-kWh battery can
               be recharged from a 240-volt, Level 2 home charger in about eight hours, a rate
               that restores about 30 miles of range each hour</p>
