        <p>Model S, the first fully electric sedan, is an evolution in automotive engineering. Combining performance, safety, and efficiency, it
           has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with
           the highest possible safety ratings, the longest range of any electric vehicle,
            and over-the-air software updates that continuously make it better.Built on the Tesla platform, the
            battery’s location on the floor gives Model S an extremely low center of gravity,
             greatly reducing the risk of rollover while at the same time enhancing handling and
             performance. Without an engine, Model S has a crumple zone much larger than other
             performance sedans to absorb the energy of a front end impact.</p>

      <p>Without much fanfare,   Tesla has added a new battery option to its menu.
      The Model S 100D, currently offers an EPA-rated
        range of 335 miles on a full charge, making it, according to Autoblog,
       the longest-range consumer electric vehicle in the world. The range is 20 miles
       greater than that of the much more expensive P100D, and 41 miles more than the Model S
       90D, which some observers expect to be phased out soon.A similar 100 kWh option is
       also now available for the Model X SUV, with a rated range of 295 miles.</p>

    <p>Tesla Autopilot is an increasingly capable
    suite of safety and convenience features that make personal transportation safer and more enjoyable.
    Since September 2014, Autopilot hardware has come standard in all Tesla vehicles, and Tesla has
    continued to refine and enhance the Autopilot system since its features were first enabled in cars
    in October 2015 via over-the-air software updates. Data shows that, when used properly, drivers
     supported by Autopilot are safer than those operating without assistance. Eventually,
    full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver.</p>

        <div class="about-text1">
          <p>Model S is designed from the ground up to be the safest car on the road.
             Much of its safety is owed to the unique electric drivetrain that sits beneath
              the car's aluminum occupant cell in its own subframe. This unique positioning
               lowers the car's center of gravity, which improves handling and minimizes rollover
               risk, and replaces the heavy engine block with impact absorbing boron steel rails.
          <br><br>  Side impacts are met by aluminum pillars reinforced with steel rails to reduce
          intrusion, protecting occupants and the battery pack while improving roof stiffness.
        In the event of an accident, eight airbags protect front and rear occupants, and the
             high voltage power source is automatically disconnected.</p>
